从Cloudwatch 摄入数据，传递给Data Firehose，通过Lambda对写入的日志进行处理后投递到 OpenSearch中
'''

"""
For processing data sent to Firehose by Cloudwatch Logs subscription filters.

Cloudwatch Logs sends to Firehose records that look like this:

{
  "messageType": "DATA_MESSAGE",
  "owner": "123456789012",
  "logGroup": "log_group_name",
  "logStream": "log_stream_name",
  "subscriptionFilters": [
    "subscription_filter_name"
  ],
  "logEvents": [
    {
      "id": "01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345",
      "timestamp": 1510109208016,
      "message": "log message 1"
    },
    {
      "id": "01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345",
      "timestamp": 1510109208017,
      "message": "log message 2"
    }
    ...
  ]
}

The data is additionally compressed with GZIP.

The code below will:

1) Gunzip the data
2) Parse the json
3) Set the result to ProcessingFailed for any record whose messageType is not DATA_MESSAGE, thus redirecting them to the
   processing error output. Such records do not contain any log events. You can modify the code to set the result to
   Dropped instead to get rid of these records completely.
4) For records whose messageType is DATA_MESSAGE, extract the individual log events from the logEvents field, and pass
   each one to the transformLogEvent method. You can modify the transformLogEvent method to perform custom
   transformations on the log events.
5) Concatenate the result from (4) together and set the result as the data of the record returned to Firehose. Note that
   this step will not add any delimiters. Delimiters should be appended by the logic within the transformLogEvent
   method.
6) Any individual record exceeding 6,000,000 bytes in size after decompression, processing and base64-encoding is marked
   as Dropped, and the original record is split into two and re-ingested back into Firehose or Kinesis. The re-ingested
   records should be about half the size compared to the original, and should fit within the size limit the second time
   round.
7) When the total data size (i.e. the sum over multiple records) after decompression, processing and base64-encoding
   exceeds 6,000,000 bytes, any additional records are re-ingested back into Firehose or Kinesis.
8) The retry count for intermittent failures during re-ingestion is set 20 attempts. If you wish to retry fewer number
   of times for intermittent failures you can lower this value.
